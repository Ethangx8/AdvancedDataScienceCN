Project for the Advanced Data Science course (Complex Networks part, 2022-2023) - UNIUD

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to analyze a network using the techniques learned during the course.

The network used for this project is the global network of migration between countries, collected by the United Nations. A directed edge gives the flow of migration, and an edge property gives the number of migrants, for each given year and sex. Estimates are presented for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 and are available for all countries and areas of the world. 

To streamline the analysis, the data spanning from 1990 to 2015 was aggregated into a single figure for each country, combining all years and genders. 

The data was gathered from https://networks.skewed.de/net/un_migrations.


## Notes

I haven't added much text to the notebook, I might add some later on.
